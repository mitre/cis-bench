## Licensing Approach

### Tool vs. Content

This software provides **format conversion functionality** - transforming CIS Benchmark data from HTML to standardized XCCDF XML format.

Under established copyright law, format conversion tools constitute independent works:

- **Tool Copyright:** The parsing methodology, transformation logic, and software architecture
- **Content Copyright:** CIS Benchmark content remains under CIS's CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 license
- **Legal Basis:** *Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone*, 499 U.S. 340 (1991); 17 U.S.C. § 102(b)

Format conversion utilities (document converters, media transcoders, data export tools) are routinely licensed independently from the content they process. This tool follows that established pattern.

### Content Attribution and Compliance

This tool:

- Requires users to authenticate with CIS WorkBench
- Does not redistribute CIS content
- Provides proper attribution to CIS
- Transforms data format only (no content modification)
- Links users to CIS terms of use

See [NOTICE.md](../../NOTICE.md) for complete third-party acknowledgments.
